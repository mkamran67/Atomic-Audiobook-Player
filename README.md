### Atomic Audiobook Reader

 #### I'm building this for Windows and Mac OS using Electron. 
 
 Windows lacks a decent Audiobook player and I wanted to mess around with Electron.
 
 Currently my primary goal is to implement it mainly for Windows, since I use Windows more then Mac OS.
 
 Current technologies used
 
 - Electron
 - React
 - TypeScript
 - TailwindCSS
 - Webpack
